Ecommerce Platform Analysis: Mobile App vs. Website - Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp Project
Congratulations! As part of the Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp, you've landed a contract with a NYC-based clothing company that offers both online and in-store experiences. They're looking for data-driven insights to determine which platform to prioritize: mobile app or website. This project will hone your linear regression skills to help them make this critical decision.

The Challenge:

The company offers style consultations in-store, followed by online purchases via mobile app or website. We'll analyze customer data to see which platform drives higher order values (total spent per purchase).

Disclaimer:

Rest assured, this data is simulated â€“ no real credit card information or emails are included.

Getting Started:

Follow these steps to analyze the customer data:

Data Exploration: Uncover patterns and trends in the provided customer data. Explore variables like purchase amount, consultation type (in-person vs. virtual), and platform used (mobile app vs. website).
Data Cleaning: Prepare the data for analysis by handling missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies.
Model Building: Using linear regression, build a model to predict order value based on the platform used (mobile app or website).
Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance by analyzing metrics like R-squared and Mean Squared Error.
Interpretation & Recommendations: Analyze the model's results to understand the relationship between platform and order value. Based on these insights, provide data-driven recommendations to the company on which platform to prioritize.
